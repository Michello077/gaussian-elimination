# Analysis of the Gaussian elimination method

More information about this project is in "Sprawozdanie z zajęć PDF.pdf" (only in Polish).

The problem of linear algebra algorithm - Gauss elimination method was addressed.

Calculations have been carried out on matrices and vectors based on the Numpy package of the Python language. Issues of cost of execution of the method depending on the given input data are described. The test sets were sets of matrices of different dimensions.
The method of least squares was used to determine the polynomial that best describes the tested relationships.

The results show the functions approximating the studied relationships. Their evaluation was based on calculation time, the number of steps performed, and the magnitude of the error in the resulting vector.
